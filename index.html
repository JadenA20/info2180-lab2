    <h2>Welcome to my blog!</h2>
    <h3>September 25, 2025 by Jaden Anthony</h3>
 
    <p>Hey there! My name is Jaden, and welcome to my blog! I created this
     page myself, via an assignment from my studies at the University of the
     West Indies. The course is called Dynamic Web Development 1, and it has been
     really interesting so far.
 
    
    </p>
    
    <p>Doing this assignment has lead me to feel more certain about pursing a career in Web/Application Development.
     Admittedly, there were hiccups getting used to the format of HTML and CSS, but the end product has definetly made it worth it.
       <div id ="Image2"> 
       <img src = "Ideas Image.png" style = "float:right; width:70px; height:70px"/>
      </div>
     Hopefully, I can continue to improve my skills and begin to work on my first major project- which is to assist my aunt
     in developing a working website for her business.
