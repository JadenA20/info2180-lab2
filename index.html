    <h2>Welcome back to my blog!</h2>
    <h4>September 25, 2025 by Jaden Anthony</h4>
 
    <p>Hey there, it's been a while! My blog has been under some construction, and I've been fixing it up
     using some knowledge gained from my studies at the University of the
     West Indies. The helpful course is called Dynamic Web Development 1, and it has been
     really interesting so far.  <img src = "Ideas Image.png" style = "float:right; width:170px; height:170px"/>
    </p>
    
    <p>The course has lead me to feel more certain about pursing a career in Web/Application Development.
     Admittedly, there were hiccups getting used to the format of HTML and CSS, but the end product has definetly made it worth it.
     Hopefully, I can continue to improve my skills and begin to work on my first major project- which is to assist my aunt
     in developing a working website for her business.
    </p>

    <p>Academics aside, it's been really hot lately. I feel as though the past few months in particular were horrid...
     On the bright side, at least time seems to be flying by, and (hopefully) November/December brings some cooler weather with it.
    </p>

     Also, I'm going to try and remain consistent with making blog posts! Not just for anyone interested, but so that 
     I can look back on them myself one day, maybe even years from now.
